Conditionals
In programming there are conditional statements that we use when we have to evaluate conditions in the programming.

In Javascript there , when we deal with conditions we deal with Truthy or Falsy values.

Falsy values are the values like Empty String , 0 , null, undefined, NaN (Not a number). All the values other than these values are termed as truthy values.
